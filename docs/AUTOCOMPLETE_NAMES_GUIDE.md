# Enhanced Autocomplete Names System

## Overview

The patient registration system now features an enhanced autocomplete functionality for names that combines a local database of common Iraqi names with Firebase integration. This system allows users to:

1. **Get instant suggestions** from a curated list of common Iraqi names
2. **Add new names** to the database when they're not found
3. **Learn from usage patterns** to improve future suggestions
4. **Access names across devices** through Firebase synchronization

## Features

### ðŸš€ Smart Suggestions
- **Local + Firebase**: Combines local Iraqi names database with Firebase-stored names
- **Gender-aware**: First names are filtered by gender (male/female)
- **Context-aware**: Different suggestion sets for first names, father names, and grandfather names
- **Real-time filtering**: Suggestions update as you type (minimum 2 characters)

### ðŸ’¾ Dynamic Learning
- **Auto-save new names**: When a user types a name not in the database, it's automatically saved
- **Usage tracking**: Names are tracked with usage counts and last used dates
- **Popularity ranking**: More frequently used names appear higher in suggestions

### ðŸ”„ Firebase Integration
- **Cloud storage**: Names are stored in Firebase Firestore for cross-device access
- **Real-time sync**: Changes are immediately available to all users
- **Scalable**: Can handle thousands of names efficiently

## Database Structure

### Firebase Collection: `names`

Each name document contains:
```json
{
  "name": "Ahmed",
  "type": "maleFirstNames",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "usageCount": 15,
  "lastUsed": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Name Types
- `maleFirstNames` - Male first names
- `femaleFirstNames` - Female first names  
- `fatherNames` - Father's names
- `grandfatherNames` - Grandfather's names

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Database Seeding

Run the seeding script to populate Firebase with common Iraqi names:

```bash
npm run seed-names
```

This script will:
- Check if names already exist in Firebase
- Add ~200 common Iraqi names if the database is empty
- Skip seeding if names already exist
- Provide detailed logging of the process

### 2. Environment Configuration

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains Firebase configuration:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### 3. Firebase Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules allow read/write access to the `names` collection:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /names/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Start typing** in any name field (firstName, fathersName, grandFathersName)
2. **View suggestions** that appear as you type (minimum 2 characters)
3. **Select a suggestion** by clicking or using arrow keys + Enter
4. **Add new names** by typing a name not in suggestions and clicking "Add [name] as new name"

### For Developers

#### Basic Usage

```jsx
import { useFirstNameSuggestions } from '../hooks/useIraqiNames';

const { suggestions, isLoading, saveNewName } = useFirstNameSuggestions(inputValue, gender);

// Use in AutoCompleteInput
<AutoCompleteInput
  value={value}
  onChange={onChange}
  suggestions={suggestions}
  isLoading={isLoading}
  onSaveNewName={saveNewName}
  showAddNewOption={true}
/>
```

#### Advanced Usage

```jsx
import { useIraqiNames } from '../hooks/useIraqiNames';

const { 
  suggestions, 
  isLoading, 
  hasSuggestions, 
  saveNewName, 
  firebaseNames 
} = useIraqiNames(inputValue, 'maleFirstNames');

// Custom save logic
const handleSaveName = async (name) => {
  const success = await saveNewName(name);
  if (success) {
    console.log('Name saved successfully!');
  }
};
```

## Customization

### Adding Custom Names

Edit the `scripts/seed-names-database.js` file to add custom names:

```javascript
const customNames = [
  { name: 'CustomName', type: 'maleFirstNames' },
  { name: 'CustomName2', type: 'femaleFirstNames' },
  // Add more custom names here
];
```

### Modifying the Local Database

Edit `src/utils/patient/iraqiNamesData.js` to modify the local names database:

```javascript
export const iraqiNames = {
  maleFirstNames: [
    // Add or modify names here
    'NewName1',
    'NewName2'
  ],
  // ... other name types
};
```

### Styling Customization

The autocomplete component uses styled-components and can be customized by modifying:

- `src/components/common/AutoCompleteInput.jsx` - Main component styling
- `src/hooks/useIraqiNames.js` - Logic and behavior
- `src/utils/patient/iraqiNamesData.js` - Data structure

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Debounced input**: 150ms delay to prevent excessive API calls
- **Memoized suggestions**: React.useMemo for efficient filtering
- **Limited results**: Maximum 10 suggestions to maintain performance
- **Lazy loading**: Firebase names are fetched only when needed

### Best Practices
- **Batch operations**: Names are added individually to maintain data integrity
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback to local names if Firebase is unavailable
- **Caching**: Local names provide instant suggestions while Firebase loads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Names not appearing**
   - Check Firebase connection
   - Verify Firestore rules allow read access
   - Run `npm run seed-names` to populate database

2. **New names not saving**
   - Check Firebase connection
   - Verify Firestore rules allow write access
   - Check browser console for error messages

3. **Performance issues**
   - Ensure Firebase project is in the same region as users
   - Check network connectivity
   - Monitor Firebase usage quotas

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your environment:

```env
VITE_DEBUG_NAMES=true
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Machine learning**: Suggest names based on cultural patterns
- **Regional variations**: Different name sets for different Iraqi regions
- **Name validation**: Check for common typos and suggest corrections
- **Analytics**: Track which names are most popular in different areas
- **Bulk import**: Import names from CSV/Excel files

### API Extensions
- **REST endpoints**: For external system integration
- **Webhook support**: Notify external systems of new names
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of the name addition system
